# Found a bug? Report it here: https://github.com/booksaw/BetterTeams/issues/new/choose (Use the bug template)
#
# Is there something annoying you about how the plugin works, or something missing? 
# Make suggestions for the future of the plugin here: https://github.com/booksaw/BetterTeams/issues/new/choose (Use the feature template)
