This file is used to track the change log for each release version, first version where the change log is used: 3.0.7. This file is used so nothing is missed out of the change log on a new update. 
This will also be reviewed once an update is released to ensure that the plugin description page is updated. 

3.0.7:
Features: 
Added the ability to create a fully custom help message (there is an option in the config for it)
